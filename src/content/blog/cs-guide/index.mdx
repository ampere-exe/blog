# Topic 1: Introduction

For some context, this guide was written because my peers and I found our journey through CS30 IB to be difficult and overwhelming as a result of the limited resources and
unclear information surrounding the course. This was written with the intention to help some of you out, to get the ball rolling, so that theres a clear framework on how to 
approach the course effectively. <Callout variant="warning">There is no guarantee that this guide is perfect--it's likely to contain several errors--but most of the information has been presented through
personal experience and research so as to aid in your completion of the course. </Callout>

## 1.1: What is the Internal Assessment

In a nutshell, the Internal Assessment for CS30IB is a practical project where you reach out to a client and develop some sort of software or product; usually a website, mobile application, or video game. 

## 1.2: Criteria and Rubric

The criteria for the internal assessment is standardized and is shown below for each of the sections being marked. It's recommended to refer back to it regularly.

## 1.3: Finding a Client
Unlike other IA's, you need to find a client for this project. Generally, the following groups of people are recommended to reach out to:

- Parents, siblings, or relatives: This is probably the easiest method and is recommended because of its flexibility. Most people should choose this option.
- Teachers or school staff: Also easy to get a client this way. However, there is much less flexibility in both software requirements and communication as most teachers/staff are busy. 
- External persons: This is much harder, but if you have the connections (to a business for example), it can be a viable option as well. Flexibility varies between individual clients, 
but generally there isn't as much freedom.

You can have a close friend (or even yourself) be a client, but it's highly recommended against. IB has a record of marking lower on projects with these types of clients.

<Callout variant="danger">
Please do not accept a request for a highly complex project as it will only make your life harder. 

There is more on this topic to be discussed, but IB markers don't care about the complexity of your program itself. They mostly care about how complex you make the program seem 
on your writeup. With this in mind, accept a project with a simple set of features and instead use extensive techniques (complex algorithms and data structures) to 
expand on your code. 
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
It's extremely advised to find a client within the first 2 weeks of school to allow time for planning and Section A.
</Callout>
## 1.4: Timeline

Your teacher will give you general due dates on when certain parts of your IA are due. It's important to adhere to these due dates if possible, especially near the end 
of your IA, as you will begin to see an increase in workload and will not have time to work on your project.

The general timeline is as follows:
| Time Period         | Tasks                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| September           | Client discovery and Section A       |
| October–November    | Learning Fundamentals and draft of Section B     |
| December–January    | Learning Advanced Concepts, starting Section C, and finishing Section B               |
| February            | Section D and Section E              |

<Callout title="Late stage planning risk"variant="warning">
Your IA will be due in sometime after February, likely March or April, however, it is *highly* recommended that you hand it in by late february or early March at the latest.
You will likely be much busier at this time and the addition of extra content to your writeup or project will net diminishing returns. 
</Callout>
# Topic 2: Writeup Guide
This section is only meant to serve as a guide, not a step by step tutorial, so essential points are kept concise. A general overview of 
what to expect for each section will be given by your teacher. 

<Callout variant="important">
Make sure you follow your teacher given exemplars religiously. This is very important. 
</Callout>

<Callout title="Writeup remarks" variant="tip">
- It's recommended to use Times New Roman or Arial. Size 12, 15, and 18 for normal text, small heading, and large heading respectively.
Its important to keep this consistent among all sections. 
- The title of all your main section documents should be in the format "Criterion X: Name of Section." Example: Criterion C: Development. This should be a large heading.
- Keep all your writeup files in a folder within your Google Drive to stay organized.
- Sections should be named "Crit_X_Y", where X is a letter and Y is the section name (example: Crit_A_Planning). Appendices should be named Appendix_A and Appendix_B. 
- Always keep referring back to your client conversations in your appendix constantly throughout all sections. In your document, it should look like "(Conversation X, Appendix Y)" where X is a number and 
Y is a letter (example: Conversation 1, Appendix B). It's important to note that references to your appendix are not considered towards your word count. 
- After handing in your section to your teacher on classroom, follow their commented advice. Look through each point of feedback and fix whatever they feel is wrong. 
</Callout>
## 2.1: Section A
<Callout variant="note">
Section A is meant to be short and completed within the first month of the school year. This is your chance to get some easy marks. 
</Callout>

For your scenario, talk concisely about your clients problem, what solutions they tried previously, and a vague description of what they want--including features and type of application.
Refer back to your appendix as much as possible here. 

For your rationale, talk about what application you're making, what features it will have, and what technologies/frameworks you are using to accomplish it (and why those certain frameworks are being used).

Your success criteria should consist of 7 bullet points--no more and no less. All bullets must concise and relate to each feature that your client wants. 

## 2.2: Section B 

Section B is more difficult, especially since you likely won't have a clue on the structure of your program. Therefore, it's recommended to do a couple parts of section B and add more as you
finish developing. This consists of adding vague structure based diagrams that don't require you to have started coding. 

Your "Test Plan" should be a copy paste of your requirements from Section A, with your test plan steps being your process to check if each requirement is met. Be as specific as possible. 

<Callout title="Good vs bad test plans" variant="example">
A bad example of a test plan is the following: 
- "Try adding an item and see if it shows up on my web page." 

A good example of a test plan is the following: 
- "Log in as the client and navigate to the catalogue
page. Attempt to add a new item, such as a 'Caliper' and observe if the item appears instantly in the inventory list with all entered details. Modify the item by updating fields like quantity,
and confirm that the change is immediately reflected in the list. Finally, delete the item and check that it is fully removed from the inventory."
</Callout>

Some diagrams to include in Section B (you can put much more than just these): 
| Before Development               |After Development                    |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| UI Mock Ups                      | UML Class Diagram (if applicable)       |
| Context Diagram                  | Algorithm Flowchart                     |
| Top Down Diagram                 |                                         |
| System Flowchart                 |                                         |

<Callout title="Section B efficiency" variant="tip">
As of writing, these were the only diagrams I put on my IA, with minimal effort, and managed to get the same mark as some of my other peers (who spent significantly more time). 
Section B is not worth spending as much time on as it may seem. It's important to focus on quality over quantity here. All diagrams should be comprehensive, easy to see, and well structured. 
</Callout>

Section B also consists of a record of tasks. This part is more flexible, so feel free to write with your preferred style and don't take too long. Make sure that you have about 50 tasks 
and that you are constantly referencing your appendix for client interactions. Moreover, avoid discussion of your writeup.
## 2.3: Section C 

Section C will be the bread and butter of your IA. I would recommend spending some time on this section as it's worth double the other sections.  

Again, your teacher will likely give more details about this section and what to expect. It's highly advised to look at their commentary when you 
hand in your draft.

<Callout title="IB code guidelines" variant="note">
You'll be taking a lot of screenshots of your code so it's important to remember a couple of things. Firstly, make sure that when taking screenshots, your background
color is light. No dark themes allowed. 

Moreover, it will be difficult to fit all of your relevant code in a single screenshot so it's advised that you only screenshot the fundamental portion of your code.
</Callout>

When writing about the structure of your code in Section C, you should look back to your Section A and take excerpts from your rationale. In the structure you will
mostly need to talk about the different layers of your program and the technologies you're using (and why you're using them). 

Your teacher will give you a list of techniques so you'll just need to browse through them and put in the ones you used and add others that were not covered.

The actual writeup and difficult portion of Section C will consist of writing about 9-10 different parts of your program. For each part you need to take screenshots of the relevant code 
and write about the purpose of that code and techniques implemented in it. Each explanation should no larger than a very short paragraph. Be concise and make your code seem complex.

Make sure to put a reference (APA style) of all resources used to develop your program at the end.
<Callout title="Integrating Section B and Section C" variant="tip">
It's highly recommended to copy paste all if not most of your figures from Section B into Section C for the relevant part of your code. IB markers will look for some sort of 
integration with Section B so this is mandatory.
</Callout>

## 2.4: Section D

Section D consists of an Extensibility portion and Functionality (video) portion. Generally, this section is not very difficult.

For the extensibility portion, copy paste your teacher given extensibility techniques list and color key highlight each technique used in your doc (use whatever colors you want). 
Afterwards, copy paste *all* your essential code and highlight each relevant portion of your code that applies to your key. 

<Callout variant="note">
If your code is too long to key everything, make sure to indicate to the marker that you will only key the first 10 pages or so of your extensibility document.
</Callout>
For the video portion, all you need to do is create a video 4-7 minutes long where you do the following:
1. Go through your exact test plan in Section B
2. Explain at least 3 extensibility features to add in the future (last 30 seconds of the video)

<Callout variant="warning">
Speeding up your video will end up in you getting potentially 0 for that section. If your video is longer than 7 minutes, your test plan is too long
and you are wasting time.
</Callout>

## 2.5: Section E

Section E is the easiest of all the sections.

For the first part, copy paste your exact test plan from Section B into your document and indicate whether each criteria was met or not. How you do this 
is up to you. 

For the client feedback, keep it concise and talk about whether your client found your product to be satisfactory or not, what they wish could be implemented,
things to improve, etc. Keep this section very short.

Finally, you'll need to talk about your 3 future improvements. For each improvement, write a very short paragraph explaining how this would help your client. 

## 2.6: Appendices 

Your appendices are not directly marked but the IB marker will refer back to them.

Appendix A is for you to list all the resources you used during your IA. This includes all websites, books, videos, etc. that you used. Make sure to cite it in 
APA format. This should be similar if not the same to your references in Section C.

Appendix B is mostly going to contain transcripts of your client conversations. You can put any other relevant information that you want the IB markers to refer back in this 
Appendix. 

# Topic 3: Development Roadmap

During the planning stages of your IA, the distinction should be made that Web Development is the most efficient route to take in order to get a high mark without investing
too much time into your project. As such, the first section of the roadmap will deal exclusively with Web Development. 

However, it's important to discern whether your product should be a website in the first place or if it's more appropriate to create a local application (like a Windows program). 
This guide won't cover how to create local desktop applications as it's impractical in most cases for an IA, but if you want to anyhow, the internet is a great place to start. 

## 3.1: Web Development

Before you start learning the basics of Web Development you need to sharpen your axe and understand how a website and its individual parts work. 

Most web applications consist of a frontend and backend, where the frontend consists of a GUI while the backend encompasses all processes and components that 
operate behind the scenes (generally a server and a database). It's recommended to watch these 2 videos to learn what each of those are and their roles in a web application:  
<div className="flex mb-5 gap-5">
    <iframe
    width="320"
    height="180"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WG5ikvJ2TKA?si=k2PhIN80bahhSVhZ" 
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    align="middle"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
    <iframe
    width="320"
    height="180"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBu54nfzxAQ?si=tF6l-fW1VAhmBVoJ"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    align="middle"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

To start, it's recommended to download an IDE/text editor--the place where you'll be writing all your code. Most people should use VSCode ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

### 3.1.1: Fundamentals
After this you can start learning. One of the most exceptional things about Web Dev is the sheer amount of resources available online to learn about the subject. As such, you can learn
the fundamentals of Web Dev through an incredible open source resource: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

To learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the basis of all Web Development, all you need to do is complete--in it's entirety--the "Foundations Course" of The Odin Project.
It will help you start with Git as a method of version control, teach basic terminal commands, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in an easy to follow manner. 

<Callout title="Warning on completing exercises" variant="important">
It's important that you complete **all** of the exercises--including projects--to make sure that you truly understand the material taught and are able to utilize it. Without doing so,
it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to move forward in learning more difficult things later on.

<Callout variant="summary">
Do your exercises!
</Callout>
</Callout>

Once you finish the foundations course, there is more flexibility on what to do. The Odin Project will allow you to choose two paths, and it's up to you what to choose, but it's recommended
to start the "Full Stack Javascript" route. Most of this part of the guide will focus on Javascript based Web Dev instead of something like Python and Ruby.

However, it's not recommended to go through everything in that course as it's redundant in most cases. If you have time, feel free to do so as the resources are excellent.

### 3.1.2: The Frontend
For most developers, just HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript might be tedious to use. In such cases, we employ the use of frameworks.

<Callout title="Framework" variant="definition">
A web framework often referred to as a web application framework is a pre-built set of libraries, software tools, and best practices that support the overall software development 
of web apps.
</Callout>

There are a plethora of frameworks and libraries to use and the one you use is up to you.  
Here is a table of common JavaScript frameworks/libraries:

| Framework/Library | Type          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| React             | Library      | A UI library for building component-based user interfaces.                  |
| Vue.js            | Framework    | A progressive framework for building user interfaces and single-page apps. |
| Angular           | Framework    | A full-featured framework for building large-scale web applications.        |
| Svelte            | Compiler     | A compiler that converts declarative components into highly efficient JS.  |
| Next.js           | Framework    | A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.     |
| Nuxt.js           | Framework    | A Vue framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.       |
| Express.js        | Framework    | A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.                   |
| jQuery            | Library      | A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library for DOM manipulation.    |

If you don't know where to start, it's highly recommended to learn and use [React](https://react.dev/) for ease of use and popularity.

To get started with React, follow The Odin Project's React Course. Here you will learn to setup [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a fast front end development tool, and learn the basics of React.

At the very least, the introduction portion of the React Course is recommended. If you are seeking a more visual and hands on approach, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) is 
an absolutely incredible resource that allows you apply what you learned immediately in it's own website through interactive coding exercises. However, it falls short sometimes
when it comes to volume of content. It's highly recommended to read up on missing parts in the Odin Project React course, as well as the official React Documentation.  

You should also be browsing some other frameworks and libraries you'd like to use in your project. Here are some commonly recommended ones and what they do:

| Category      | Library / Tool   | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Styling / UI  | Tailwind CSS     | Utility-first CSS framework                   |
| Styling / UI  | DaisyUI          | Tailwind plugin with prebuilt components     |
| Styling / UI  | ShadCN           | Tailwind + Radix UI component library        |
| State         | Redux            | Centralized state management                 |
| State         | Zustand          | Minimalist state management for React        |
| API / Fetch   | Axios            | Promise-based HTTP client                     |
| API / Fetch   | React Query      | Server state management and caching          |
| Animation     | Framer Motion    | Animations for React                          |
| Utilities     | Lodash           | Collection of utility functions               |
| Utilities     | Day.js           | Date manipulation                              |

These are only a few that you can use. If you want to find anything specific you can look for it. 

The minimum i'd recommend are the following:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (In my opinion, mandatory)
- A UI library: [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) are highly recommended
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

<Callout title="IA start time" variant="note">
At this point you should be starting to create your IA project.
</Callout>
### 3.1.3: The Backend

Once you have a good grasp of Frontend Web Development, it's time to start learning about Backend Web Development. 

<Callout title="Should you have a backend?" variant="important">
It may be the case that your application doesn't need a backend, but if you want a high mark in your IA, it's highly recommended to integrate some sort of backend or database 
to show complexity. 
</Callout>

In most web applications, the backend consists of a server and a database. The database stores all the information used by the application while the server takes 
responsibility for routing and moving information between the front end and database. 

However, even if this is the case for most applications, it's much easier and more time efficient to use a BaaS that does everything for you. Moreover, it's 
usually simpler to host (we'll cover this more later). However, if you want more control over your backend, you might stick to choosing your own server side language and database.

If you choose the latter, The Odin Project can help you start learning how to use Node.js alongside PostgreSQL. If in doubt, check their respective documentation.

When choosing a BaaS there are some distinctions to make. The two main ones recommended are [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), but the one you use is up to you.

You can use the following table to help you make the decision:

| Feature       | Firebase (Google)                     | Supabase (Open Source)           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Database      | NoSQL (Firestore, Realtime DB)         | SQL (PostgreSQL)                  |
| API           | Client SDKs, REST                      | REST, GraphQL, client libraries   |
| Auth          | Built-in                               | Built-in                          |
| Real-time     | Yes                                    | Yes                               |
| Hosting       | Yes                                    | No (DB + APIs only)               |
| Open Source   | No                                     | Yes                               |
| Pricing       | Usage-based, can scale up costs        | Usage-based, can scale up costs   |
| Vendor Lock   | High                                   | Medium                            |


Firebase is recommended if you need your backend to work on the fly without much intervention, but Supabase is my personal recommendation as it's more flexble and open source.
You can't go wrong with etiher of these so watch these videos to learn more about each and pick the one you like:

</div>

To learn each of these, simply visit their respective documentation. 
### 3.1.4: Deployment 

When creating a web application, you'll generally want somewhere to host a website so that people can view it through a domain. 

Some free hosting services include the following:

| Service   | Type                  | Free Tier Limits                                | Notes                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Vercel    | Frontend hosting, SSR | 125 GB bandwidth/month, 1 GB storage            | Great for Next.js, instant deployments |
| Render    | Full-stack hosting    | 750 compute hours/month, free PostgreSQL (limited) | Supports web services & static sites   |
| Netlify   | Frontend hosting, CI  | 125 GB bandwidth/month, 300 build minutes       | Strong JAMstack support                |
| GitHub Pages | Static site hosting   | Unlimited bandwidth for public repos            | Only for static content                 |
| Cloudflare Pages | Static site hosting   | Unlimited requests & bandwidth                  | Free CDN, great for performance         |
| Railway   | Full-stack hosting    | $5/month free credit (~500 compute hours)       | Auto-deploy from Git, DB support        |
| Fly.io    | Full-stack hosting    | 3 shared CPUs, 256 MB RAM, 3 GB storage         | Good for Docker apps                    |

Generally, it's recommended to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as it's easy to interface. However, the other options are all very viable so use the one that you find is most appropriate.

<Callout title="Avoiding deployment errors" variant="tip"> 
Some deployment services have errors when deploying as a result of their respective processes. It's highly recommended that you either make sure that your GitHub
application deploys seamlessly from the get go, or to use a template (from Vercel) and build your product off of it.  

This will prevent deployment headaches later on.
</Callout>

To deploy your project, simply follow the instructions displayed by your selected service.
