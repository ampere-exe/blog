## Topic 1: Introduction

For some context, this guide was written because my peers and I found our journey through CS30 IB to be difficult and overwhelming as a result of the limited resources and
unclear information surrounding the course. This was written with the intention to help some of you out, to get the ball rolling, so that theres a clear framework on how to 
approach the course effectively. There is no guarantee that this guide is perfect--it's likely to contain several errors--but most of the information has been presented through
personal experience and research so as to aid in your completion of the course. 

### 1.1: What is the Internal Assessment

In a nutshell, the Internal Assessment for CS30IB is a practical project where you reach out to a client and develop some sort of software or product; usually a website, mobile application, or video game. 

### 1.2: Criteria and Rubric

The criteria for the internal assessment is standardized and is shown below for each of the sections being marked. It's recommended to refer back to it regularly.

### 1.3: Finding a Client
Unlike other IA's, you need to find a client for this project. Generally, the following groups of people are recommended to reach out to:

- Parents, siblings, or relatives: This is probably the easiest method and is recommended because of its flexibility. Most people should choose this option.
- Teachers or school staff: Also easy to get a client this way. However, there is much less flexibility in both software requirements and communication as most teachers/staff are busy. 
- External persons: This is much harder, but if you have the connections (to a business for example), it can be a viable option as well. Flexibility varies between individual clients, 
but generally there isn't as much freedom.

You can have a close friend (or even yourself) be a client, but it's highly recommended against. IB has a record of marking lower on projects with these types of clients.

Also, please do not accept a request for a highly complex project as it will only make your life harder. There is more on this topic
to be discussed, but IB markers don't care about the complexity of your program itself. They mostly care about how complex you make the program seem 
on your writeup. With this in mind, accept a project with a simple set of features and instead use extensive techniques (complex algorithms and data structures) to 
expand on your code. 

It's extremely advised to find a client within the first 2 weeks of school to allow time for Planning.
### 1.4: Timeline

Your teacher will give you general due dates on when certain parts of your IA are due. It's important to adhere to these due dates if possible, especially near the end 
of your IA, as you will begin to see an increase in workload and will not have time to work on your project.

The general timeline is as follows:
| Time Period         | Tasks                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| September           | Client discovery and Section A       |
| October–November    | Learning Fundamentals and finishing Section B     |
| December–January    | Learning Advanced Concepts and Section C               |
| February            | Section D and Section E              |

Your IA will be due in sometime after February, likely March or April, however, it is *highly* recommended that you hand it in by late february or early March at the latest.
You will likely be much busier at this time and the addition of extra content to your writeup or project will net diminishing returns.
