# Problem

### How can we save our water?

As of the modern age, despite our incredible and awe-striking developments in the sustainable technology sector, we 
have fallen behind expectations as engineering advancements relating to the production of water body filtering vehicles has stagnated... completely. 

The current issue as it stands is not at all the lack of resources--in fact, it is clear that we're more than able to develop such vehicles with great ease--but 
rather, the more arduous component of the problem, getting society to even begin caring about it. There is no guarantee that just because we do not 
take care of our earth, that it will take care of us. 

After spending a great deal of time analysing this issue, as a duo of altruistic engineers, we want to provide a solution--our EcoNautilus--which is not just a vehicle,
but a movement: one that promotes the creation of highly sustainable and low-cost cost water body filtrations systems.
