## Introduction

The idea to even ponder about making an instrument came from my physics class. As we're learning
about waves and harmonics, our teacher had the _brilliant_ idea to assign us, in groups of 2, a project
that entailed creating an instrument from scratch--and one without the use of any professional equipment
or resources.

Of course, I hate new assignments, but this one in particular, seemed to be one of the rare few that seemed
interesting to me. With that in mind, the first thing that I wondered when this was assigned was 
_"what instrument would I want to make?"_ After some serious thought, I settled on a lyre harp. 
Unlike a guitar or flute--your commonly found instruments--it seemed to look interesting and unique, standing beside everything 
else, with a history and breathtaking mythic visual that compelled it towards me.
