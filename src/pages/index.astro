          My name is Zuhair Emaz and i'm an aspiring engineer from Canada. I
          also go by my alias ampere_exe.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty text-md mb-2">
          Outside of being a student, i'm also a strength athlete who's
          interested in Olympic Weightlifting, Powerlifting, and
          Bodybuilding. To put it simply, if I wasn't allowed to become an engineer—and I was talented enough—I 
          would probably want to be a professional weightlifter.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          Although i'm usually busy, in my free time I enjoy reading, writing, programming, cooking, and
          playing videogames (sometimes). This blog is mainly for me to write and share about my thoughts and
          ideas—to convey both the magic of computers, and the beauty of weightlifting—so that everyone can
          appreciate them.
